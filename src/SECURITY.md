# CyberWhale Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CyberWhale ecosystem to ensure the protection of user data, system integrity, and service availability. The security architecture follows industry best practices and adheres to a defense-in-depth strategy.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Email verification required during registration
   - Optional SMS verification for additional security
   - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support for secure login

2. **Session Management**
   - Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
   - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Longer refresh tokens (7 days) with secure rotation
   - Automatic session timeout after inactivity

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Fine-grained permission system
   - Principle of least privilege implemented throughout the system

### Data Protection

1. **Data at Rest**
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data storage
   - Secure key management
   - Database-level encryption

2. **Data in Transit**
   - TLS 1.3 enforced for all connections
   - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) implemented
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy supported

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Personal data minimization
   - Configurable data retention policies
   - GDPR and CCPA compliance measures

### Application Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation for all user inputs
   - Content security policy (CSP) implementation
   - Protection against injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, XSS, etc.)

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Request throttling
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with appropriate security claims

3. **Frontend Security**
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection
   - Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Network Security**
   - Web application firewall (WAF)
   - DDoS protection
   - Network segmentation
   - Regular vulnerability scanning

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Comprehensive security logging
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Automatic alerts for suspicious activities
   - Audit trails for sensitive operations

3. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Regular automated backups
   - Encrypted backup storage
   - Tested recovery procedures
   - Geographic redundancy

## Secure Development Practices

1. **Secure SDLC**
   - Security requirements defined at project inception
   - Threat modeling during design phase
   - Regular code reviews with security focus
   - Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning for dependencies
   - Software composition analysis (SCA)

3. **Security Testing**
   - Static application security testing (SAST)
   - Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Bug bounty program

## Incident Response

1. **Incident Detection**
   - 24/7 security monitoring
   - Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
   - Integration with threat intelligence feeds

2. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Documented response procedures
   - Defined roles and responsibilities
   - Regular tabletop exercises and simulations

3. **Post-Incident Activities**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Lessons learned documentation
   - Security posture improvement

## Compliance

The CyberWhale platform is designed to meet the requirements of:

- ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- SOC 2 (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy)

## CTF Platform Security

The CTF (Capture The Flag) platform incorporates additional security measures:

1. **Challenge Isolation**
   - Docker containerization for challenges
   - Network isolation between challenges
   - Resource limitations to prevent DoS

2. **Flag Submission Protection**
   - Anti-bruteforce mechanisms
   - Rate limiting for submissions
   - Unique flags for each user session when applicable

3. **Competition Integrity**
   - Anti-cheating mechanisms
   - Scoreboard protection
   - Secure real-time updates

## AI Assistant Security

The AI Assistant implementation includes specific security controls:

1. **Data Protection**
   - Minimal data retention for conversations
   - Anonymization of sensitive information
   - Option for users to delete conversation history

2. **Model Security**
   - Regular security updates for AI models
   - Input sanitization before processing
   - Output filtering to prevent harmful content

3. **Integration Security**
   - Secure API communication
   - Authenticated and authorized access only
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Security Testing and Verification

All security measures are regularly tested and verified through:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Continuous security scanning
   - Regular vulnerability assessments
   - Compliance checking

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Regular penetration testing by internal team
   - Periodic third-party security assessments
   - Red team exercises

3. **User Education**
   - Security awareness materials
   - Best practice guidance
   - Clear security documentation
